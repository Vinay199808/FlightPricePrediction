# Flight Price Prediction
----------------------
## Project Overview ðŸ“—
----------------------
Prices for airline tickets might be challenging to estimate. In order to construct a model that predicts travel prices using multiple input features, we have been given the pricing of flight tickets for a number of airlines between the months of March and June 2019 and between a number of places.

We have 2 datasets here â€” training set and test set.

The training set contains the features, along with the prices of the flights. It contains 10683 records, 10 input features and 1 output column â€” â€˜Priceâ€™.

The test set contains 2671 records and 10 input features. The output â€˜Priceâ€™ column needs to be predicted in this set. We will use Regression techniques here, since the predicted output will be a continuous value.

Following is the features available in the dataset â€“ Airline, Date_of_Journey, Source, Destination, Route, Dep_Time, Arrival_Time ,Duration, Total_Stops, Additional_Info, Price.
